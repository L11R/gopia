# gopia

Currently `gopia` is a small tool to quickly generate WireGuard configs by using Private Internet Access API.

Based on user interest it could get more futures in the future.

### Why? There is an official repo!

Because the official one uses `bash` which is not available on Windows for at least.
`gopia` uses Go, so it can be compiled for almost everything.
